# 🥚 egg file format

**egg** is a next-generation, self-contained, portable, and executable document format for reproducible code, data, and results.

Inspired by the metaphor of the egg—slow to build, instant to hatch—egg files deliver “just works” experiences for scientific, analytic, and computational notebooks in any language, on any machine, with zero configuration.

## Features

- **Self-contained:** Everything you need—code, data, runtimes, outputs—in a single `.egg` file.
- **Multi-language:** Compose any number of languages/interpreters (e.g. Python, APL, Julia, R, custom VMs).
- **Zero-config:** No installation, no dependencies; "hatch" an egg on any system with the egg viewer.
- **Reproducible:** Deterministic build; every run gives the same results.
- **Secure:** Strong sandboxing via micro-VMs; safe to run untrusted code.
- **Scalable:** Designed for the future—handles GBs to TBs of data and code with instant load.
- **Audit & provenance:** Build logs and full environment info are baked into every file.

## Why "egg"?

> Like an egg, your document is crafted slowly and deliberately, encasing everything needed for life. When you hatch it—instant, perfect, agile execution.

- **Build time is slow, careful, deliberate.**
- **Run time is instant, agile, and reliable.**
