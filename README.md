**egg** is a self-contained, portable, and executable document format for reproducible code, data, and results. Inspired by the egg metaphorâ€”slow to build, instant to hatchâ€”it aims to make notebooks in any language "just work" on any machine with zero configuration.

---

## Features

- **Self-contained:** Everythingâ€”code, data, runtimes, outputsâ€”bundled in a single `.egg` file.
- **Multi-language:** Mix Python, APL, Julia, R, or custom VMs in one archive.
- **Zero-config:** Hatch an egg anywhere without installing dependencies.
- **Reproducible:** Deterministic build process ensures consistent results.
- **Secure:** Strong micro-VM sandboxing for untrusted code.
- **Scalable:** Designed for GBâ€“TB scale data with instant loading.
- **Audit & provenance:** Full build logs and environment info baked in.

*This repository implements a minimal prototype with additional agents for fetching runtimes, sandboxing, precomputing outputs and deterministic chunking. The broader features above are planned for future releases.*

## Quick Start

Install the CLI and build the demo archive:

```bash
pip install -e .  # install in editable mode to load example plug-ins
egg build --manifest examples/manifest.yaml --output demo.egg --precompute
egg hatch --egg demo.egg
egg verify --egg demo.egg
egg info --egg demo.egg
egg clean .
```
A file `<source>.out` is created for each executed cell containing stdout. If a
cell fails, its stderr is written to `<source>.err` for later inspection.

For a Julia example see `examples/julia_manifest.yaml`.
A full manifest mixing twelve languages is provided in `examples/dozen_manifest.yaml`.
The example plug-ins used above are described in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#plug-in-development).

## Writing Plug-ins

Egg can be extended with custom Python packages. Each plug-in exposes a
`register()` function and is distributed like any other package:

```
my-egg-plugin/
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â””â”€â”€ my_pkg/
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ runtime.py      # runtime plug-in
    â””â”€â”€ hello_agent.py  # agent plug-in
```

Place the `register()` function in the module referenced by your entry
point. A minimal `pyproject.toml` looks like:

```toml
[project.entry-points."egg.runtimes"]
python = "my_pkg.runtime:register"

[project.entry-points."egg.agents"]
hello = "my_pkg.hello_agent:register"
```

At start-up the CLI calls `egg.utils.load_plugins()`, which scans the
`egg.runtimes` and `egg.agents` entry point groups, imports each module
and invokes its `register()` function. Runtime plug-ins return a mapping
of language names to command lists, while agent plug-ins run for their
side effects.

Install your plug-in like any other package and run the CLI with the
`-vv` flag to confirm it loads:

```bash
pip install my-egg-plugin
egg -vv --help  # shows "[plugins] loaded ..." messages
```

See [examples/](examples/) for sample plug-ins and
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#plug-in-development) for more on agent architecture
and plug-in development.

## Advanced Usage

The manifest `examples/advanced_manifest.yaml` demonstrates how to
declare dependencies and enable permissions:

```yaml
name: "Advanced Notebook"
description: "Example demonstrating dependencies, permissions, and mixed languages"
dependencies:
  - python:3.11
  - r:4.3
  - bash:5
permissions:
  network: true
  filesystem: true
```

It runs Python, Bash and R cells from the `examples/` directory. Build
and hatch it like so:

```bash
egg build --manifest examples/advanced_manifest.yaml --output advanced.egg --precompute
egg hatch --egg advanced.egg
```

---

## CLI Overview

```bash
egg build  --manifest <file> --output <egg> [--precompute] [--signing-key <file>]
egg hatch  --egg <egg> [--no-sandbox]
egg verify --egg <egg> [--signing-key <file>]
egg info   --egg <egg>
egg languages
egg clean  [path] [--dry-run]
```

Use `egg <command> -h` to see all options. Runtime commands and other settings can be configured via environment variables; see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

The `clean` command removes `precompute_hashes.yaml`, `*.out` and `*.err` files,
and any `sandbox` directories beneath the given path. Use `--dry-run` to list
targets without deleting them.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `EGG_CMD_PYTHON` | Command executed for Python cells |
| `EGG_CMD_R` | Command executed for R cells |
| `EGG_CMD_BASH` | Command executed for Bash cells |
| `EGG_SIGNING_KEY` | HMAC key used to sign `hashes.yaml` |
| `EGG_REGISTRY_URL` | Registry base URL for runtime downloads |
| `EGG_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` | Default timeout (seconds) for runtime downloads |

### Testing

```bash
pip install .       # installs the CLI
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit run --all-files
```
This formats code, lints with flake8 and pylint, runs tests with coverage,
and updates the README badges.
